## Introduction
This repository is a personal learning journal, documenting the core concepts and techniques I've encountered while mastering Python. I believe in a hands-on approach to learning and have created various projects that incorporate these topics, allowing me to apply my knowledge practically.

## What I've Learned

### Variables
Understanding how to declare and use variables to store data.

### Strings & String Methods
Exploring string manipulation, including common methods like `.upper()`, `.lower()`, `.strip()`, and more.

### Lists & List Methods
Getting familiar with lists as mutable sequences, along with methods to manipulate them, such as `.append()`, `.remove()`, and `.sort()`.

### Tuples
Learning about tuples, their immutable nature, and how to use them effectively in Python.

### Dictionaries
Understanding dictionaries as a collection of key-value pairs and the various methods to work with them.

### Flow Control Statements
**Loops** - Mastering `for` and `while` loops for iterating over data.
**Conditionals** - Utilizing `if`, `elif`, and `else` statements to control the flow of the program.
**Break & Continue Statements** - Learning how to exit from a loop or skip an iteration with `break` and `continue`.

### Memory & Memory Reference
Understanding how Python manages memory and how references work.

### String Manipulation
Advanced techniques for manipulating strings, combining them, and formatting output.

### Escape Characters
Familiarizing myself with special characters like newline (`\n`) and tab (`\t`) in strings.

### Regular Expressions
Using regular expressions for advanced pattern matching in strings.

### Input Validations
Creating robust input validation methods to handle user input effectively.

### Importing Modules
Learning to leverage Python's standard libraries by importing modules to extend functionality.

### Reading & Writing Files
Understanding file operations to read from and write to files effectively.

### Lambda Functions
Exploring the use of anonymous functions with the `lambda` keyword.

### Arrays & Array Methods
Working with arrays as a more efficient alternative to lists for numerical data.

### Classes & Objects
Diving into object-oriented programming principles, including defining classes and creating objects.

### Garbage Collection
Understanding Python's automatic memory management and garbage collection.

While I was learning this language, I concluded that I would never be able to master the language (I mean, I couldn't say that "I finished learning Python and this is the end", more things will keep coming), I will keep updating this whatever I learn while building project and progressing more into the career.

Let's see how far this goes! ;)
